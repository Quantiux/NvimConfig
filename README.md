# Neovim config

This repo contains my configuration files for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), focusing primarily
on setting up an IDE for Python and R for my data science projects. Repo includes essential
features such as auto-completion, lsp, debugger, linter, formatter and git-integration, and
some additional features, viz. ChatGPT integration, Tabnine code completion and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) integration for note taking. This configuration can be easily extended to almost any other language with appropriate plugins.

Screenshot below shows how my Neovim setup looks, with a `lua` and a `conf` file open on split,
and LSP clients for the active lua buffer displayed at the bottom (theme [Tokyonight-storm](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)).
As for the rest, I use [Awesome tiling WM](https://github.com/Quantiux/awesome) with [Polybar](https://github.com/Quantiux/polybar) at the top,
[Picom](https://github.com/Quantiux/picom) compositor (with 95% opacity and `dual_kawase` blur),
and [Alacritty](https://github.com/Quantiux/alacritty) terminal with JetBrainsMono Nerd Font.
