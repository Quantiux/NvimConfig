# Neovim config

This repo contains my configuration files for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), focusing primarily
on setting up an IDE for Python and R for my data science projects. Repo includes essential
features such as auto-completion, lsp, debugger, linter, formatter and git-integration, and
some additional features, viz. ChatGPT integration, Tabnine code completion and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) integration for note taking. This configuration can be easily extended to almost any other language with appropriate plugins.
